Skype calls (continuous call lengths) adaptive learning games

participants want to best respond:

Both participants gain utility according to how close the call length is to their ideal time.

Participants can signal to each other when they want to end the call.

If they didn't care about each other they would end the call as soon as the first person wants to end the call.

However participants care about each others utility.

If they do care about the others utility they have to figure out through signaling.

censored process: at every second people know if their partner has signaled they want to end the call yet or not.

People observe their past end times and use that to inform information about their partners utility/preferred end time which affects their utility.

Shaky hand

Continuous outcomes

Monotonic over the range  for both parties.
